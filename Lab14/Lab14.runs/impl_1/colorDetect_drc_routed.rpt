2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
REQP-161#1 Error
connects_CLKINSEL_VCC_connects_CLKIN1_ACTIVE  
clk_10/inst/plle2_adv_inst: The PLLE2_ADV with CLKINSEL tied high requires the CLKIN1 pin to be active.
Related violations: <none>

IOSTDTYPE-1#1 Critical Warning
IOStandard Type  
I/O port TMDS_Tx_Clk_N is Single-Ended but has an IOStandard of TMDS_33 which can only support Differential
Related violations: <none>

IOSTDTYPE-1#2 Critical Warning
IOStandard Type  
I/O port TMDS_Tx_Clk_P is Single-Ended but has an IOStandard of TMDS_33 which can only support Differential
Related violations: <none>

IOSTDTYPE-1#3 Critical Warning
IOStandard Type  
I/O port TMDS_Tx_Data_N[0] is Single-Ended but has an IOStandard of TMDS_33 which can only support Differential
Related violations: <none>

IOSTDTYPE-1#4 Critical Warning
IOStandard Type  
I/O port TMDS_Tx_Data_N[1] is Single-Ended but has an IOStandard of TMDS_33 which can only support Differential
Related violations: <none>

IOSTDTYPE-1#5 Critical Warning
IOStandard Type  
I/O port TMDS_Tx_Data_N[2] is Single-Ended but has an IOStandard of TMDS_33 which can only support Differential
Related violations: <none>

IOSTDTYPE-1#6 Critical Warning
IOStandard Type  
I/O port TMDS_Tx_Data_P[0] is Single-Ended but has an IOStandard of TMDS_33 which can only support Differential
Related violations: <none>

IOSTDTYPE-1#7 Critical Warning
IOStandard Type  
I/O port TMDS_Tx_Data_P[1] is Single-Ended but has an IOStandard of TMDS_33 which can only support Differential
Related violations: <none>

IOSTDTYPE-1#8 Critical Warning
IOStandard Type  
I/O port TMDS_Tx_Data_P[2] is Single-Ended but has an IOStandard of TMDS_33 which can only support Differential
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Camera_IIC_SDA_IOBUF/IBUF (in Camera_IIC_SDA_IOBUF macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Driver_IIC0/inst/IIC_Busy is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Driver_IIC0/inst/IIC_Busy_INST_0/O, cell Driver_IIC0/inst/IIC_Busy_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT Driver_IIC0/inst/IIC_Busy_INST_0 is driving clock pin of 10 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
Diver_OV5647_Init/inst/Enable_reg, Diver_OV5647_Init/inst/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[0], Diver_OV5647_Init/inst/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[1], Diver_OV5647_Init/inst/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[2], Diver_OV5647_Init/inst/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[3], Diver_OV5647_Init/inst/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[4], Diver_OV5647_Init/inst/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[5], Diver_OV5647_Init/inst/FSM_sequential_Write_State_reg[6], Diver_OV5647_Init/inst/Reg_Addr_reg, Diver_OV5647_Init/inst/Reg_Data_reg
Related violations: <none>
